this is a demo project for showing how mobiwek61 menu gets configured.  
In **src**:
- **DevMenuSpec.js** defines the menu structure
- **ReactAppForDevelopment.js** defines React.js routes which match those setup in the menu.

- This app was created using `npx create-react-app my-app` and so contains demo files
unrelated to this project. It uses **HtmlWebpackPlugin** by default, so script tags in index.html are missing, which works fine in this case.



I hope to expand this readme in the future to make it more useful.
