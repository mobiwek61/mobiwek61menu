this is a demo project for showing how mobiwek61 menu gets configured.  
in src, DevMenuSpec.js defines the menu structure and ReactAppForDevelopment.js
defines React.js routes which match those setup in the menu.

This is a first phase of putting on github;
I hope to expand this readme in the future to make it more useful.
