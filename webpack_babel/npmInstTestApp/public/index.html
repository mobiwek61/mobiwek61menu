      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a
      user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/

    <!--
      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

  <!--  ????????  WHERE IS THE SCRIPT TO START REACT ??????????
    This is the entry point for a React app, but the script tag to start up react is NOT THERE!. 
    That's because the "npx create-react-app my-app" utility configures webpack using
    the HtmlWebpackPlugin which automagically inserts a script tag to call index.js before running
    the app. The custom webpack config setup in the other part of this project does not do this,
    instead the tag is in the code. -->
